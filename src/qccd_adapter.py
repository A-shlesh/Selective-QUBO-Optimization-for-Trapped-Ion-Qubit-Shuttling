qccd_adapter.py

Bridges two Position Graph models that describe the same physical idea
(traps, transport, capacity) in two different shapes:

  qccd/position_graph.py (newer, richer module)
      A trap is ONE node that can directly hold up to `capacity` ions.
      "Ion A and ion B are co-located" = they're both in the same
      node's occupant set.

  src/position_graph.py (the model ShawRoutingPass currently expects)
      A trap with capacity C is C separate "slot" nodes, one ion each.
      "Ion A and ion B are co-located" = they're at two slots that
      share the same trap_id.

ShawRoutingPass (shaw_routing_pass.py) is written against the second
shape and we don't want to touch it. So instead of reworking the
routing pass, this module wraps a qccd PositionGraph and exposes it
through the *slot-based* interface ShawRoutingPass already calls:

    pg.graph.nodes[pos]["trap_id"]   (via ShawRoutingPass._trap_of)
    pg.slots_of(trap_id)
    pg.shortest_path(a, b)
    Placement.place / .move / .position_of / .occupant_of / .is_occupied
    Placement._occupant   (reached into directly by _swap_ions -- see
                            shaw_routing_pass.py's own note on that)

How: every real qccd node with capacity C becomes C "virtual slots"
here, named (real_node_id, slot_index). A qccd TRAP node's virtual
slots report their real node_id as trap_id; a CHANNEL/JUNCTION node's
virtual slots report trap_id=None (matching "transport nodes report
None" -- ShawRoutingPass only treats trap_id-bearing positions as
"the same trap").

Known simplifications (documented, not hidden):
  - When choosing which slot represents a real node the path merely
    passes through, we prefer a free one but fall back to slot 0 if
    none exists -- see QccdPositionGraphAdapter.shortest_path.
  - A cross-node edge in qccd connects two real nodes; here we connect
    every virtual slot of one to every virtual slot of the other so an
    ion in any slot of a trap can path out through that edge. Real
    hardware would need an internal shuffle to the boundary slot first;
    we simplify that to a single hop, consistent with this being a
    "thin adapter" rather than a full re-model.
