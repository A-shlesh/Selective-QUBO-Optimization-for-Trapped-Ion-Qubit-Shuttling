position_graph.py

Implements the Position Graph abstraction from:
    Bach, Safro, Younis - "Efficient Compilation for Shuttling Trapped-Ion
    Machines via the Position Graph Architectural Abstraction" (arXiv:2501.12470)

Definition 1 (paraphrased): a labeled graph G_p = (V, E, psi) where
  - each vertex is a physical *position* an ion can occupy
    (either a slot inside a trap, or an intermediate transport position)
  - each edge is a legal transition between two positions
  - psi labels each edge as one of: "swap", "merge_split", "move"
        swap        -> transition between two slots *inside the same trap*
        merge_split  -> transition between a trap-boundary slot and a
                        transport ("segment") position
        move        -> transition *between* transport positions
                        (e.g. across a junction, or along a segment)

This module gives you:
  - PositionGraph: build traps + segments/junctions, wire them together
    with correctly-labeled edges
  - Placement: the Phi function -- tracks which logical qudit currently
    sits at which physical position (this changes during routing; the
    PositionGraph itself is static)
  - build_linear_qccd(): a small factory for a simple "chain of traps"
    architecture, good enough to sanity-check routing logic on toy circuits

NOTE / SCOPE: this is a deliberately simplified first version. The full
Definition 1 vertex/edge-count formulas handle junctions of arbitrary
degree (multiple traps meeting at one junction). This version supports
linear chains and star-shaped junctions, which is enough to get SHAW's
core routing loop working end to end. Extending add_junction() to
arbitrary degree is a clean, isolated follow-up -- it does not require
touching Placement, congestion detection, or anything built on top of
this module.
